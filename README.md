# Overview
I am trying to learn more about asynchronous programming as well as Flutter and Dart and what they can do.

This web/mobile app is written in Dart using the Flutter framework.

My purpose for creating this software was two fold. One was I wanted a place on my phone that I could quickly see Crypto Currency prices without having to create an account or enter my email anywhere. Second was to try my hand at stateful widgets and seeing more clearly how they work and how async methods work along side them.

# Development Environment

For this project I used Android Studio Dolphin patch 2021.3.1 and Flutter 3.1, and Dart 2.19. My machine is an M1 Pro Macbook Pro runnning macOS Monterey.

This program is written in Dart. "Dart is a client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to ogget the most productive programming language for mulit-platofrm development, paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks."
